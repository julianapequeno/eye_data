# Project Overview
| Date | What happened | What's next? | What Am I thinking | Issues |
| ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| 03-12-24 | First time collecting data from the EyeTracker with Python| Read documentation and play with its functions | I want to try to connect to Tobii Pro Lab or another visualization tool. I think it will help with the project. 
| 03-14-24 | Searching about TBSDK and how to visualize the gaze vector in my screen| I think I will try to start studying about PSYCHOPY and TOBII PRO LAB. It might help | I would love to make an analysis in a person watching a video. Besides, it would be cool to make up a interface with PyQT for the project. We could connect it with the eye traker without many struggling.
| 03-19-24 | I got to install Psychopy in the lab's machine. Also, I've started to learn about this package, and linux itself. Moreover, I enrolled on a [PsychoPy couse](https://www.djmannion.net/psych_programming/vision/index.html) | Keep on my studies of this package and learn how everything goes. Then, I will like to learn how to put tobii eyetracker in communication with this program. | I've just found out that I'm working with Stimulus Presentation (Psychology). I'm happy because today I had a good progress in this project, but I should walk step-by-step. It's going to be great! :) |
| 04-02-24 | Ubuntu distro broke down in the lab's computer. I've spent 2 hours solving this with some friends. Basically, I did a reboot and installed Zorin OS :) | Now I have to reinstall wxPython and PsychoPy again. I'm having some trouble with it, again...I'm gonna try to reinstall python, though this time with another version of it | I really would like to see it working with PsychoPy very soon... |
| 04-03-24 | I've finished installing all the packages back in the computer. And finally, got psychopy working connected with the eyetracker. With that, I could try for the first time to build a routine in psychopy. | Now it's time to learn how to use psychopy as well as learn how to write python scripts for routines. | I'm happy! =) Got some youtube videos to watch, I think it's going to be fun!| 
| 04-04-24 | I presented this project to some professors and this gave me motivation for keep going | I will work on how to work in the eyetracker with python scripts and watch psychopy video lessons | Feeling excited! |
| 04-05-24 | I could show the project to more people from those professors' lab. It was a good experience. Also, I've started to work on psychopy scripts on python. I want to create a window and show the gaze vector from the eyetracker there. | Psychopy Documentation's study and psychopy video lessons | I want to try to create some mini projects with this. I think it will be very good for me and my learning process! |  
| 04-09-24 | I started learning how to use Psychopy with this playlist: [PsychoPy Help Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6PJquR5BWXllUt585cRJWcRTly55iXTm). I learned how to run a routine on the program. | I want to keep on my studies, whatch those videos and get to the part when it connects with Eyetracker | I'm thinking about doing some mini-projects while I study | 
| 04-16-24 | After a week, I'm back (tests week). Today I've explored the eyetracker through python, tobii SDK and psychopy packages. I've discovered some packages created by users and tried in my computer. So there's two new folders here called [External Packages](/external_packages) and [Data](/data), which refers to implementations and results respectivily. I also installed the packages with pip, I will append the issue refering to this at the final of this report. Today, I found out that I can use what It's ready and start to explore the data with pyth on scripts. | I want to explore gaze data, and try to do something nice with it. Exploring data analysis - I need to study more about this. Also, I want to keep on my video lessons about psychopy. | I'm thinking that I'm about to start something very nice. I was thinking of creating a script that explore how the person looks at the screen based on what she/he is hearing. Connecting with sound modules. Another idea is that, I can use clustering to identify where the person looks more at the screen (?) Look at [brincando.py](/data/shiroyang/brincando.py), it's me brainstorming these things =) | #8 |
| 04-19-24 | Today I came back to lab with the intention of exploring eye tracker's data's output. Then, I went with HeatMap. | I need to come back to Psychopy videos, and maybe think about other ways of exploring data. | I would love to make a mini-project in which we can collect data based on what the person is looking at in a video for example. It would be awesome (It'll be need to work with timestamp as well). ALthough, I think a nice way of keep on is to learn more about psychopy and get more information about stimulus and psychology. ALso, I was thinking about looking at how TobiiProEyeTrackerManager represents a gaze vector and plot on screen. I would love to do the same in future applications|
| 04-22-24 |  Today I studied about gaze maping and how does the Eyetracker works under covers. It was a good research to do today and understand more some points that were difficult for me before. Also I finished the 1st class of the Psychopy course, and started the 2nd one. | I think keep on the youtube course and try to find out how to print a realistic heatmap of the gaze data inside of the computer screen scale | I'm a little bit tired of watching the videos because I'm more into coding. But I think that's a part of the work :) |
| 05-03-24 (Morning) | I finally finished the second video lessson of that Psychopy youtube series, and with that it went the introduction to the plataform. Now, there is exploration and specific tasks. Though I did not see how to connect with the eyetracker yet | I was searching about the possibility of buying Tobiipro lab 'cause it looks to be better for managing the data and the experiment. Although I will stick to Psychopy and learn. I found this link that I will work on and study by the afternoon: [psychopy-eyetracking](https://psychopy.org/hardware/eyeTracking.html), also there they suggest a site for oppening a .hdf5 file and how to visualize the data as a heatmap. Another link for this afternoon: [overlay-video-pyqt](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47627879/overlay-video-with-custom-graphics-using-phonon-pyqt/47629016#47629016) | It's a little but tiring to come back to work after some days off, but I'm happy that I did it and that's part of the journey. | #9 |
| 05-14-24 | Today I came back to work, and It was awesome! I got to do my first psychopy experiment with the eyetracking and finally got how to show the gaze on the screen!! Also, I opened a new project here on github https://github.com/julianapequeno/eyetracking-in-psychopy | I think I will organize the script for another project that a project wants my help with | Feeling hopeful! | :) |
| 05-16-24 (morning)| Today I decided to keep on my project on Psychopy with the eyetracker. I got to got the data and now I'm analying it with Panda-Python. Now I can know how many time did the participant looked at some point on the screen and calculate how long did he/she pass looking at it. | I will play with psychopy! | This was fun. I like 'cause involves data science | | 
| 05-17-24 | I had a meeting with my professor and he gave me new instructions and directions for the project. Also, He brought a webcam for using in psychopy. | Play with the new webcam | Excited!| |
| 05-21-24 | Today I studied more about the webcam and struggled with the new computer (I'm back to windows). I got to run a program that shows the webcam image in psychopy | I need to got the eyetracker data with psychopy, there's something not working yet. Also, Today I started to write the doc about psychopy (in portuguese) | Tired, but hopeful that Thrusday i will get to do more progress on this project | | 
| 05-23-24 | Today I got to watch a video about Stroop Exp inside Psychopy, and the support formatted my PC. Then, it was a little bit of a little step, but It counts! | I will keep on how to manage webcams inside Psychopy | Hungry :p | |
| 06-04-24 | - I watched another video about Psychopy <br> - Started the docs for the upcoming lecture <br> - I got to work on data extraction with the video. It works with the cam and the mics | - I want to read the documentation (keep on) and study deeply on Psychopy <br> - Want to work connecting eyetracking and the webcam | Actually, fine, I dont know if I'm walking slow, though I want to keep on! | |
| 06-05-24 | Today was awesome! I got to the lab early and decided to study about Psychopy and its related plataforms. I've written a lot more for that doc. Learned about PsychoJS, Pavlovia and online exps. Also, I learned how psychopy translates from Python to Javascript when it comes to run the exps online, though this translation can cause some troubles and it should be paid attention on.  | I want to: <br> - Start this workshop: https://workshops.psychopy.org/3days/ <br> - Keep on reading Psychopy's documentation <br> - Write more of the document about Psychopy <br> - Maybe explore more videos on youtube. These are helping a lot! | Feeling happy and excited with all this new discoveries | |
| 06-07-24 | I read some of the workshop material and tried new tasks in Psychopy. Also, I improved the webcam trial and tried to unify with eyetracking | I want to do that workshop and write down what I'll be learning, I think it's a good material for who is starting with Psychopy. | Feeling tired because it's friday haha :) |  |
| 06-10-24 | Hey! Good monday :) Today I got to run eyetracking exps together with webcam and audio. It's finally here guys! (In the other repo) It worked. Though, now at the end, it's started to appear errors. | I think I will keep on this. I was thinking about an activity that does: wherever the person looks at for longer than 3sec, it begin to appear a explanation about the object. So, this would be build by an AI also. Another thing, I want to found out how to save the data from the eyetracking inside of the Psychopy builder interface. There's what I really need | Feelling tired from the weekend, but happy for this progress. | |
| 06-11-24 | Today I got to test the script running with the webcam and the eyetracker in both linux and windows OPs, found out that there are some errors in linux that I have to look more deep later (all is documented in issue #11), and in windows I got to improve the script, adding the funcionallity of the camera viewer while the person is doing the exp (I uploaded the script in the other repo that I have here at my account) | I was thinking about doing a exp that the person can see how much close or away he/she is from the eyetracker during watching the video (Idea: connect with titta), also, I want to improve the data collector, probably it would be nice to hit the old scripts again. | Learning :) | |
| 06-13-24 | Happy day :) I did some things: <br> - I solved the problem about webcam on Linux. TOday I worked on linux only, just so I could fix the script. <br> - I tested with the eyetracker, the webcam and also the movie component (all works :)) <br> - I learned how to run the exp by terminal and I decided to make an .sh file so people can run the exp not having to open psychopy, but psychopy should be in the computer. | Now, I want to move on and try new components inside psychopy. And I still have to test these exps in MACBOOK. Also, I need to continue my research and write the doc about psychopy. | Very happy! Got to solve some bugs and problems today :) | |
| 06-19-24 | I wrote a introduction in the paper | I want to read more of the documentation. I think there's lot more to learn and write about | Feelling anxious | |
| 06-21-24 | I read some info about psychopy and had a meeting (brief) with my Professor | I have to keep searching and studying the 3 day workshop | Terrific |
| 07-02-24 | I had to stop for a week due to my assignments in undergrad, but I came back and I'm focusing on writing andd preparing the docs for the presentation for the final of this month | I will translate and study the workshops materials made available by Psychopy.org <br> Also, I will study that 3-day workshop and keep building my doc| Feeling: I built a brick for the wall :) | |
| 07-03-24 | Today I filled the mini-course repo with slides from Psychopy.org, and I started to study the material about it. | I will keep translating and studing the 3-day-Psychopy Course to complete the material or the mini-course | Feeling: Waalking step by step. | |
| 07-08-24 | I worked on the mini-course doc, read more material of Psychopy and tried to install psychopy on my linux (unfortunatelly it is not working yet)  | keep on | feeling: okay | | 
| 07-09-24 | Today I tried again to install it on linux, I have to make a pipeline for others and it's been difficult due to it. So, besides that today I read and fount a lot of material from others universities labs on Psychopy, like basic courses. Exactly what I'm doing here. Well, I read and did 85% of the class number 1. There's a lot to show. Though I'm happy for doing this for the portuguese community :) | I will keep on this. | Feelling: Tired, more than 3 hours working on this today  | | 
| 07-10-24 | I worked on mini-course and I did a very great progress on it. Still at the first class "Exploring the Builder". Found out that there's a LOT do say! I'm pretty excited to develop this material in portuguese. | Producing material, reading and writing! | Happy | |
| 07-11-24 | Okay. I think today was the day that I worked the most during the last few months. I'm very focused on the project. I started the day searching about Psychopy download for linux, though I did not get yet. But I wrote a lot and I believe that I'm on 90% of class 1!! Happy! | Finish class 1. Read and watch more videos about psychopy | Happy, a little bit tired, but veeery excited! | | 
| 07-12-24 | Unfortunately I didnt have much time, though I could improve a little bit of the design of the repo. Love it. | mini-course | tired | | 
| 07-15-24 | Today I reached 99% of the first class and I'm happy for this! | Finalizing the first class | A little bit overwhelmed. There are lots of things to write about | |
| 08-05-24 | I FIND IT! https://discourse.psychopy.org/t/setting-eyetracking-roi-with-builder-and-size/24627 | Finally | Need to make it work. Or at least start building it | |
| 08-09-24 | I had a meeting with a researcher, we are doing a colab with his project. | Work on the topics mentioned| So excited!! | |
| 08-12-24 | Worked on the sentences of PT dataset | Keep on that | Good | |
