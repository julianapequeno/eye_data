# Project Overview
| Date | What happened | What's next? | What Am I thinking | Issues |
| ---- | ---- | --- | --- | --- |
| 03-12-24 | First time collecting data from the EyeTracker with Python| Read documentation and play with its functions | I want to try to connect to Tobii Pro Lab or another visualization tool. I think it will help with the project. 
| 03-14-24 | Searching about TBSDK and how to visualize the gaze vector in my screen| I think I will try to start studying about PSYCHOPY and TOBII PRO LAB. It might help | I would love to make an analysis in a person watching a video. Besides, it would be cool to make up a interface with PyQT for the project. We could connect it with the eye traker without many struggling.
| 03-19-24 | I got to install Psychopy in the lab's machine. Also, I've started to learn about this package, and linux itself. Moreover, I enrolled on a [PsychoPy couse](https://www.djmannion.net/psych_programming/vision/index.html) | Keep on my studies of this package and learn how everything goes. Then, I will like to learn how to put tobii eyetracker in communication with this program. | I've just found out that I'm working with Stimulus Presentation (Psychology). I'm happy because today I had a good progress in this project, but I should walk step-by-step. It's going to be great! :) |
| 04-02-24 | Ubuntu distro broke down in the lab's computer. I've spent 2 hours solving this with some friends. Basically, I did a reboot and installed Zorin OS :) | Now I have to reinstall wxPython and PsychoPy again. I'm having some trouble with it, again...I'm gonna try to reinstall python, though this time with another version of it | I really would like to see it working with PsychoPy very soon... |
| 04-03-24 | I've finished installing all the packages back in the computer. And finally, got psychopy working connected with the eyetracker. With that, I could try for the first time to build a routine in psychopy. | Now it's time to learn how to use psychopy as well as learn how to write python scripts for routines. | I'm happy! =) Got some youtube videos to watch, I think it's going to be fun!| 
| 04-04-24 | I presented this project to some professors and this gave me motivation for keep going | I will work on how to work in the eyetracker with python scripts and watch psychopy video lessons | Feeling excited! |
| 04-05-24 | I could show the project to more people from those professors' lab. It was a good experience. Also, I've started to work on psychopy scripts on python. I want to create a window and show the gaze vector from the eyetracker there. | Psychopy Documentation's study and psychopy video lessons | I want to try to create some mini projects with this. I think it will be very good for me and my learning process! |  
| 04-09-24 | I started learning how to use Psychopy with this playlist: [PsychoPy Help Tutorial Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6PJquR5BWXllUt585cRJWcRTly55iXTm). I learned how to run a routine on the program. | I want to keep on my studies, whatch those videos and get to the part when it connects with Eyetracker | I'm thinking about doing some mini-projects while I study | 
| 04-16-24 | After a week, I'm back (tests week). Today I've explored the eyetracker through python, tobii SDK and psychopy packages. I've discovered some packages created by users and tried in my computer. So there's two new folders here called [External Packages](/external_packages) and [Data](/data), which refers to implementations and results respectivily. I also installed the packages with pip, I will append the issue refering to this at the final of this report. Today, I found out that I can use what It's ready and start to explore the data with pyth on scripts. | I want to explore gaze data, and try to do something nice with it. Exploring data analysis - I need to study more about this. Also, I want to keep on my video lessons about psychopy. | I'm thinking that I'm about to start something very nice. I was thinking of creating a script that explore how the person looks at the screen based on what she/he is hearing. Connecting with sound modules. Another idea is that, I can use clustering to identify where the person looks more at the screen (?) Look at [brincando.py](/data/shiroyang/brincando.py), it's me brainstorming these things =) | #8 |
| 04-19-24 | Today I came back to lab with the intention of exploring eye tracker's data's output. Then, I went with HeatMap. | I need to come back to Psychopy videos, and maybe think about other ways of exploring data. | I would love to make a mini-project in which we can collect data based on what the person is looking at in a video for example. It would be awesome (It'll be need to work with timestamp as well). ALthough, I think a nice way of keep on is to learn more about psychopy and get more information about stimulus and psychology. ALso, I was thinking about looking at how TobiiProEyeTrackerManager represents a gaze vector and plot on screen. I would love to do the same in future applications|
| 04-22-24 |  Today I studied about gaze maping and how does the Eyetracker works under covers. It was a good research to do today and understand more some points that were difficult for me before. Also I finished the 1st class of the Psychopy course, and started the 2nd one. | I think keep on the youtube course and try to find out how to print a realistic heatmap of the gaze data inside of the computer screen scale | I'm a little bit tired of watching the videos because I'm more into coding. But I think that's a part of the work :) |
