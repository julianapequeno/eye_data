# Project Overview
| Date | What happened | What's next? | What Am I thinking |
| ---- | ---- | --- | --- |
| 03-12-24 | First time collecting data from the EyeTracker with Python| Read documentation and play with its functions | I want to try to connect to Tobii Pro Lab or another visualization tool. I think it will help with the project. 
| 03-14-24 | Searching about TBSDK and how to visualize the gaze vector in my screen| I think I will try to start studying about PSYCHOPY and TOBII PRO LAB. It might help | I would love to make an analysis in a person watching a video. Besides, it would be cool to make up a interface with PyQT for the project. We could connect it with the eye traker without many struggling.
| 03-19-24 | I got to install Psychopy in the lab's machine. Also, I've started to learn about this package, and linux itself. Moreover, I enrolled on a [PsychoPy couse](https://www.djmannion.net/psych_programming/vision/index.html) | Keep on my studies of this package and learn how everything goes. Then, I will like to learn how to put tobii eyetracker in communication with this program. | I've just found out that I'm working with Stimulus Presentation (Psychology). I'm happy because today I had a good progress in this project, but I should walk step-by-step. It's going to be great! :) |
| 04-02-24 | Ubuntu distro broke down in the lab's computer. I've spent 2 hours solving this with some friends. Basically, I did a reboot and installed Zorin OS :) | Now I have to reinstall wxPython and PsychoPy again. I'm having some trouble with it, again...I'm gonna try to reinstall python, though this time with another version of it | I really would like to see it working with PsychoPy very soon... |
